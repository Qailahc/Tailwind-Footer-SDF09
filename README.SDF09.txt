Tailwind Footer SDF09 Project

Overview
For this project, I developed an understanding of tailwind and how to incorporate the CSS coding within the HTML.

Reflections
Areas of Mastery

CSS Layout Techniques: I am skilled in utilizing Flexbox and Grid for organizing web page elements. Applying these methods to position and arrange content was a standout aspect of my learning.

Responsive Design: I struggled a bit with ensuring the page appears well on desktop and mobile screens.

Styling Elements: I succeeded in styling most elements the way I desired.

Challenges Faced

Responsive Design for Smaller Screens: It was difficult to change text sizes and layouts on smaller screens. In order to maintain consistency and functionality in the design, I had to test out various strategies.


Areas for Improvement


Code Optimization: Even though my code produced the desired result, I think it could be more effective and easier to comprehend.

Creative Design Choices: For practice, I stuck quite similar to the Tailwind Footer example we've been given, but for future projects, I'd like to try out some more imaginative design options.

Overall Learning Experience

This project provided me with a great deal of practical experience using Tailwind approaches. I look forward to diving deeper into Tailwind and understanding the concepts. Through my next projects, I hope to further hone these abilities, and I'm excited to expand on these abilities. I only wish I had more time to learn everything which was needed for this project.
